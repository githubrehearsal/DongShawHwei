msgid "The “Courtyard” series by Dong Shaw-Hwei presents a delightful breakthrough of the artist’s painting style resultant from years of nurtured skills in [what Michael Polanyi has called] the “tacit knowing”.  What makes Dong stand out among her fellow Taiwanese artists is that whereas (pretentious) vulgarity, (self-indulgent) narrow-mindedness, (eccentric) perversity, and triteness in their crafts oftentimes prevail in the cultural circle of Taiwan(as well as in  contemporary art circles ), Dong is not affected because of her original and vital creativity.  Thus, the artist is able to blend her genuine feeling and penetrating insight without pretentiousness.  In this case the artist’s deployment of the resources of the impressionist school has led to a “creative transformation” of traditional Chinese cultural elements."
